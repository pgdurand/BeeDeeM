Step 1 - check your system
--------------------------

  To install BeeDeeM you need:

    1. the Java Runtime from Oracle, release 1.7 or above ;
    2. the Ant system from Apache Foundation, release 1.6 or above

  To check whether or not these dependencies are available on your 
  system, run the following from the command-line:

      $ java -version
      $ ant -version

  If these systems are installed, proceed to step 2.

  If Java is not installed, please proceed to the Oracle Java web site.

  It Ant is not installed, enter the directory 'ant' located in this 
  distribution, then unzip the file located there. Check the 'ant/bin' 
  directory and check and/or set 'rx' permissions on the Ant scripts:
  'ant' and 'antRun'.

  When both Java and Ant are available, update the 'envDDMS' file 
  according to your system.

  Then, do the following on the command-line:

      $ source envDBMS (Mac/linux)

Step 2 - configure BeeDeeM
--------------------------

  Edit the file 'config.properties', and follow the instructions of 
  that file.

Step 3 - install BeeDeeM
------------------------

  When the file 'config.properties' is updated, do the following on 
  the command-line:

  If you are root:
      $ ant -f deploy.xml install

  Otherwise:
      $ sudo ant -f deploy.xml install
