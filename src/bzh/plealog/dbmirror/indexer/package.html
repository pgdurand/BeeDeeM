This package contains the code to parse and index sequence databanks.
</p>
<p>
In addition to classes aim at parsing databank sequence files (SwiiProt, GenBank, Fasta, etc), the package also contains classes making the Lucene Storage Framework used by KDMS. This Framework consists of Lucene indexes that can be queried by sequence IDs. An index mainly stores: name of original databank sequence file, sequence Ids and locations (start, stop in bytes) of all entries in that file. This Framework consists of classes and interfaces StorageSystemXXX and LuceneStorageXXX. They are associated to a utility class called LuceneUtils.
