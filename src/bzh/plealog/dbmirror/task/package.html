This package contains the code of the Task framework of the DBMS installation processor.
</p>
<p>
This processor is represented by class PTaskEngine which can be viewed as a FIFO stack of PTask objects. When started, PTaskEngine will execute automatically each PTask using a timer. 
</p>
<p>
There are two major types of tasks:
</p>
<p>
1. PTask: a standard task
</p>
<p>
2. PParserTask: a task aims at reading a databank file (sequence or biological classification)
</p>
<p>
Stack of PTasks is prepared by the LoaderMonitor system.
